# Hash Generator
This is a simple C# script that calculates the MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes of a file. To use it, compile the script and then drag and drop a file onto the executable. The console will remain open so you can inspect the results.

Alternatively, you can download a pre compiled file from the releases tab.

# Prerequisites
.NET framework (version 5.0 or later)

# Usage
- Compile the script using a C# compiler such as Visual Studio or download a pre compiled file from the releases tab.
- Drag and drop a file onto the executable.
- The console will display the MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes of the file.
- Press any key to exit the console.

# Note
The .NET framework version you choose must be installed on the machine where the program will be run.
